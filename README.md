# Optimal Patrol Allocation using Evolutionary Programming

## Project Overview
This project aims to optimize the allocation of patrols across planetary systems to minimize total patrolling time using Evolutionary Programming. The problem is modeled as an Open Shop Scheduling Problem (OSSP) and solved through stochastic simulation techniques. The implementation in **Java** applies object-oriented programming principles to simulate patrol allocation, ensuring efficient distribution through evolutionary operations such as mutation, reproduction, and selection.

## Implementation Details
- **Language**: Java
- **Methodology**: Evolutionary Programming with Stochastic Simulation
- **Execution**: Command-line interface (CLI)
- **Key Features**:
  - Randomized initial allocation
  - Evolutionary optimization techniques
  - Real-time monitoring of results

## How to Run the Project
